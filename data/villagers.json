        "description": "Big Top is a lazy, elephant villager in the Animal Crossing series. He first appears in Doubutsu no Mori e+ and also Animal Crossing: Wild World and Animal Crossing: City Folk. His name may be a reference to the main arena of a circus, the big top, where elephants are mainly situated in a circus. It may also be a joke on the size of elephants, who are large mammals, or \"big\" in this case. His initial phrase, \"villain\", plays along with his superhero charm and appearance. Some believe he may be a villain to the four other superhero villagers, Kid Cat, Agent S, Rocket, and Filly, with his picture in Animal Crossing: Wild World quote being \"World domination!\" and his phrase could be a tag placed on him to mark him as the evildoer in the game, though it depends on opinion.",

        "description": "Zucker is a lazy octopus villager in the Animal Crossing series. He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf and was one of the first new villagers announced for that game. His English name comes from ‘sucker,’ like those found on an octopus's tentacles, while his Japanese name and overall appearance refer to takoyaki, a popular Japanese food made with octopus. Zucker shares his catchphrase with Bertha, a normal hippo villager.",
