Appearance-wise, Beau is very similar to an antelope, a deer-like creature common in many parts of Africa and Eurasia, although Antelope themselves are more related to Cows than actual deer.",

The name Tybalt is most likely taken from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, being named after the character of the same name. This is especially considering that another character in the play makes a scene of nicknaming Tybalt the \"King of Cats,\" which in itself is a reference to Tybalt/Tibert the Cat from the story of Reynard the Fox. His Japanese name is the alias of the Japanese bandit Tani Yukata who was active in Malaya, Harimau, which is Malay for \"tiger.\"",

Although she is absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World, she later reappears in Animal Crossing: City Folk, her debut in a game released to the west.
